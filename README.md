<h3>ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m @kovalenko359</h3>
I am 14 years old. I am interested in the inner workings of computers, operating systems, microcontrollers and their programming, as well as creating various projects using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I am also interested in web design and the server-side of websites. Here, I will be sharing my projects under the GNU GPL v3.0 license. Feel free to fork my repositories and suggest code changes. Iâ€™m currently learning PHP, JS, Python, C/C++, Assembly.
